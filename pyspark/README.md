# Difference between Spark and Hadoop Map Reduce
# Spark
Spark is an open source analytics engine that is used for fast data processing using distributed architecture.
The high speed data processing in Spark is attributed to the in-memory processing of data as opposed to Map Reduce.
Spark can be used for both batch processing and real-time stream processing, as opposed to Hadoop Map Reduce that is useful for batch processing only.
Even though Spark is faster, it should be kept in mind that Spark usage can be costly as it requires higher memory. The higher the memory the better the processing speed.

Spark follows the above archiitecture.
